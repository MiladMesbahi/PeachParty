# PeachParty

Peach Party is a two-player game that takes place in a board game world where the players control Peach and Yoshi avatars. The objective of the game is to collect coins and stars while avoiding obstacles like Bowser and Boo. The game consists of nine different boards with varying layouts and challenges, and players have 99 seconds to collect as many coins and stars as possible. If players have the same number of coins and stars, the winner is randomly chosen. The game is played by rolling a virtual 10-sided die using specific keys, and players move their avatars accordingly. The game features special squares that activate certain powers, like granting or deducting coins or stars or teleporting players. Players can also fire Vortex projectiles to attack obstacles if they have them. The game is controlled using different keys for Peach and Yoshi, and there are built-in commands for the game developer to use. Here is a screenshot of the game.
